## 🎯 What Changed

### GUI Architecture

```
BEFORE (Learning during waking):
┌─────────────┐
│  User Input │
└──────┬──────┘
       ↓
┌──────────────────┐
│  Agent.step()    │
└──────┬───────────┘
       ↓
┌──────────────────┐  ❌ WRONG!
│ Selector.learn() │  Weight optimization
└──────┬───────────┘
       ↓
   Behavior changes (but where's the cognitive plausibility?)


AFTER (Learning during sleep):
┌─────────────┐         ┌──────────────────────┐
│  User Input │         │  Experience Storage  │
└──────┬──────┘         └──────────────────────┘
       ↓                             ↑
┌──────────────────┐                │
│  Agent.step()    │────────────────┘
└──────────────────┘
                    (No learning!)
                        
                    User provides feedback
                              ↓
                    Rating: 😊 → Intensity: 0.8
                              ↓
                    "Use 🌙 Sleep for learning"
                              ↓
                    ┌──────────────────────┐
                    │  Click: 🌙 Sleep     │
                    └──────┬───────────────┘
                           ↓
                    Sleep Consolidation:
                    • Replay experiences
                    • Cluster similar patterns
                    • Create semantic patterns
                    • Forget unstable traces
                           ↓
                    Behavior EMERGES ✓ (Cognitive!)
```

---

## 🚀 New Features

### 1. Sleep Consolidation Dialog (🌙 Button)
```
Shows:
  • Status before sleep
  • Consolidation parameters
  • Results after consolidation
  • Cycle counter
  
Allows:
  • Choose 1-10 consolidation cycles
  • View clustering details
  • Monitor pattern formation
```

### 2. Enhanced Inspector (5 Tabs)
```
Tab 1: Episodic Memory
  → Experiences in hippocampus
  → Intensity, reinforcement, activation
  
Tab 2: Semantic Memory  
  → Patterns created by sleep
  → (⚠️ Empty until first sleep!)
  
Tab 3: Action Selection
  → Shows selector is NON-LEARNABLE
  → Pressure-based, no weights
  → Confidence threshold
  
Tab 4: Consolidation
  → Sleep pipeline details
  → Consolidation efficiency
  → Memory statistics
  
Tab 5: Statistics
  → Overall cognitive state
  → Cycles, patterns, experiences
  → Consolidation ratio
```

### 3. Intensity-Based Feedback
```
Before: Rating → Direct weight optimization
After:  Rating → Convert to intensity (0.2-1.0)
                 ↓
                 Store experience
                 ↓
                 Will be learned in sleep!

Scale:
  😞 = 0.2 (очень плохо)
  😐 = 0.4 (плохо)
  🙂 = 0.6 (нейтрально)
  😊 = 0.8 (хорошо)
  😍 = 1.0 (отлично)
```

"Авто-тренировка" button   ← Now shows deprecation warning
```

Weight bar charts          ← Removed
Learning rate display      ← Removed
```

### Direct Learning
```
Selector.learn()           ← Removed

---

## ✅ Verification

### All Tests Passing
```bash
$ python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py"

Ran 81 tests in 0.136s
OK ✓

15 GUI tests         ✓
15 Agent tests       ✓
15 Hippocampus tests ✓
13 Selector tests    ✓
11 Sleep tests       ✓
14 Experience tests  ✓
1 Trainer test       ✓
```

### NOWA Principle Verified
```
Question: If selector is frozen, will behavior change 
          when agent gets new experience?

Answer: ✅ YES - through sleep consolidation
  • Selector has NO weights (can't freeze weights)
  • New experiences go to hippocampus
  • Sleep consolidates to patterns
  • Selection uses patterns (not weights)
  • Behavior EMERGES ✓
```

### Architecture Integrity
```
✓ All imports work
✓ No learning during waking
✓ Learning only during sleep
✓ Experiences are immutable
✓ Selector is non-learnable
✓ SleepManager is only learning mechanism
✓ Feedback converts to intensity
✓ Patterns form only in sleep
✓ Inspector shows true state
✓ Consolidation cycles tracked
```

## 🎓 Usage Guide

### Quick Start
```python
# Launch GUI
import tkinter as tk
from src.gui import NOWAGUI

root = tk.Tk()
gui = NOWAGUI(root)
root.mainloop()
```

### Three-Step Workflow

**Step 1: Waking (Gather Experiences)**
```
1. Type message to agent
2. Agent responds (no learning yet!)
3. Rate response (😊 = good)
4. Experience stored with intensity
```

**Step 2: Sleep (Learn from Experiences)**
```
1. Click 🌙 Сон button
2. Set cycles: 3-5
3. Watch consolidation:
   - Experiences clustered
   - Patterns created
   - Cycles incremented
```

**Step 3: Behavior Change (Emerges)**
```
1. Type same message again
2. Agent's behavior has changed!
3. Why? From consolidated patterns!
4. Selector has NO weights but still changed
```

### Inspector Usage
```
Click: Инспектор

Before Sleep:
  • See many experiences
  • See 0 patterns
  • Selector has no weights

After Sleep:
  • See patterns created
  • Consolidation cycle count
  • Pattern statistics
```

## 🎯 NOWA Principle

### The Core Idea
> **"Behavior is not learned. It emerges from experience and sleep."**

### The Implementation
1. **Experiences** are immutable historical records
2. **Waking** stores experiences without optimization
3. **Sleep** consolidates experiences to patterns
4. **Behavior** emerges from selection pressure (patterns + activation)
5. **Selector** is non-learnable (no weights to optimize)

### The Proof
- Selector has NO `weights` attribute
- Selector has NO `learn()` method
- All learning in `SleepManager.sleep_cycle()`
- Patterns only exist after consolidation
- GUI shows all this clearly!
