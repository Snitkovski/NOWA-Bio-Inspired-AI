# NOWA GUI Refactoring - Complete Summary

Russian version: [GUI_REFACTORING_SUMMARY.ru.md](GUI_REFACTORING_SUMMARY.ru.md)



**Status (27 September 2026).** A core document. The current scientific exposition of the complex, in Russian and in English, is [SCIENTIFIC_DESCRIPTION.en.md](SCIENTIFIC_DESCRIPTION.en.md). The text below retains the wording of its original drafting: a normative module contract or a laboratory record.


## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The NOWA-Cognitive GUI has been fully refactored to work with the new cognitive architecture where behavior emerges through sleep consolidation rather than waking learning.

---

## What Changed

### Core Principle
**Before:** Learning during waking activity (ML/RL style)
**After:** Learning ONLY during sleep consolidation (cognitive neuroscience style)

### In the GUI

#### ❌ Removed
- Training/Auto-Training dialogs (violate NOWA principles)
- Selector weight visualization (selector has NO weights)
- Learning rate parameters
- Direct feedback→learning loop
- SelectorTrainer usage

#### ✅ Added
- **🌙 Sleep Button** - Manual consolidation control
- **Sleep Dialog** - Shows consolidation statistics
- **Enhanced Inspector** - 5 tabs with consolidation details
- **Intensity-based Feedback** - Experiences with intensity values
- **Cognitive State Display** - Consolidation cycles, patterns, experiences

#### 🔄 Modified
- Experience loading (→ hippocampus, not direct to cortex)
- Statistics display (consolidation cycles, pattern counts)
- Memory visualization (episodic + semantic separation)
- Feedback processing (store with intensity, no learning)

---

## Key Features

### 1. Waking Activity (No Learning)
```
User Input → Agent.step() → Store Experience (immutable)
                               ↓
                         No selector learning!
```

### 2. Sleep Consolidation (Only Learning)
```
Click 🌙 Sleep → Configure cycles → Consolidate experiences
                                    ↓
                            Cluster similar experiences
                                    ↓
                            Create semantic patterns
                                    ↓
                            Forget unstable traces
                                    ↓
                        Behavior EMERGES from patterns!
```

### 3. Feedback Mechanism
```
User rates 😞-😍 → Converts to intensity (0.2-1.0)
                          ↓
                    Stores experience
                          ↓
                  "Use 🌙 Sleep for learning"
                          ↓
                    Will consolidate in sleep
```

### 4. Inspector Tabs
1. **Episodic Memory** - Experiences in hippocampus
2. **Semantic Memory** - Patterns created by sleep
3. **Action Selection** - Pressure-based (no weights)
4. **Consolidation** - Sleep pipeline details
5. **Statistics** - Overall cognitive state

---

## Technical Details

### Updated Components

**src/gui.py**
- Removed SelectorTrainer imports
- Added SleepManager initialization
- Created `open_sleep_dialog()` method
- Updated `open_inspector()` with 5 tabs
- Modified `submit_feedback()` to use intensity
- Updated `update_stats()` to show consolidation cycles
- Changed `_add_experiences_to_agent()` to use hippocampus.store()
- Added deprecation warning for training dialogs

**Tests Added**
- tests/test_gui_refactoring.py - 15 comprehensive GUI tests
- Verifies all NOWA principles in GUI context
- Tests sleep consolidation workflow
- Tests non-learnable selector
- Tests immutable experiences
- Tests feedback mechanism

### Import Changes
```python
# Old imports (removed)
from sleep_manager import SleepManager
from trainer import SelectorTrainer

# New imports (added)
from sleep import SleepManager
from experience import EventType
```

### API Changes
```python
# Initialize GUI components
sleep_manager = SleepManager(hippocampus, cortex)  # No interval/thread
agent = Agent(hippocampus, cortex, selector, sleep_manager)

# Processing
action = agent.step(context)  # No reward parameter

# Learning (ONLY during sleep)
stats = agent.sleep(cycles=N)

# Feedback (converts to intensity)
intensity = (rating + 3) / 5.0  # -2..2 → 0.2..1.0
```

## User Guide

### Using the Refactored GUI

#### 1. Start Agent
```
Launch GUI → Initialize components
```

#### 2. Interact During Waking
```
Type message → Agent responds
Rate response (😞-😍) → Experience stored
```

#### 3. Consolidate During Sleep
```
Click 🌙 Sleep → Choose cycles (1-10)
→ Watch consolidation progress
→ Behavior changes through patterns!
```

#### 4. Inspect Cognitive State
```
Click Инспектор → Browse 5 tabs
→ See experiences, patterns, selection
→ Verify consolidation working
```

#### 5. Load/Save
```
Load dataset → Experiences go to hippocampus
Save state → Stores hippocampus, cortex, selector
Sleep → Consolidates and creates patterns
```

## Core NOWA Principle

### The Question
"If selector is frozen and agent gets new experience, will behavior change?"

### The NOWA Answer
✅ **YES, through sleep consolidation:**

1. New experiences go to hippocampus (immutable)
2. Selector has NO weights (can't be "frozen" with learning)
3. Sleep consolidates experiences → patterns
4. Selection uses hippocampal activation + patterns
5. Behavior EMERGES from consolidation

### Proof in GUI
- Selector has no `weights` attribute
- No `learn()` method on selector
- All learning happens in `SleepManager`
- Patterns only appear after sleep
- Consolidation cycles counter increments

---

## Deprecated Features

### Training Dialog
```python
def open_training_dialog(self):
    # ❌ Removed - violates NOWA principles
```

### Auto-Training Dialog
```python
def open_auto_training_dialog(self):
    # ❌ Shows deprecation warning:
    # "Autom training selector больше не поддерживается.
    #  В NOWA обучение происходит ТОЛЬКО во время сна."
```

### SelectorTrainer
```python
from trainer import SelectorTrainer

trainer = SelectorTrainer(...)
# ❌ Raises NotImplementedError
# Message explains use SleepManager instead
```
