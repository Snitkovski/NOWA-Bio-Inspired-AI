# Project Progress Update — Plan B Complete

Russian version: [PROJECT_PROGRESS.ru.md](PROJECT_PROGRESS.ru.md)

**Status (27 September 2026).** A core document. The current scientific exposition of the complex, in Russian and in English, is [SCIENTIFIC_DESCRIPTION.en.md](SCIENTIFIC_DESCRIPTION.en.md). The text below retains the wording of its original drafting: a normative module contract or a laboratory record.

## Update — February 18, 2026 (Phase 6.2.1)

Current project status after Phase 6.2/6.2.1 implementation:

- Implemented strict filtered sleep consolidation with gating, caps, and diagnostics.
- Added TD history statistics (`td_mean_snapshot`, `td_variance_snapshot`) in waking/feedback.
- Adopted **Variant A** architecture: sleep replay does not mutate TD statistics.
- Added and expanded tests for Phase 6.2 behavior and determinism.
- Latest full suite result: **388 passed, 3 skipped**.

Note: the content below describes the historical Plan B delivery snapshot (168 tests at that time).

## Summary

Plan B (Temporal Chains, Proto-Strategy, and Credit Assignment) has been **successfully implemented**, tested, and integrated into the NOWA-Cognitive project.

**All 168 tests pass.**

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Core Implementation

| Module | Changes |
|--------|---------|
| `temporal_chains.py` (NEW) | `TemporalChain` and `ChainMemory` classes |
| `sleep.py` | `_form_chains_from_recent()` method, chain formation during sleep cycles |
| `selector.py` | Chain bias acceptance and proto-strategy decision-making |
| `agent.py` | Compute and pass chain_bias to selector |
| `gui.py` | Display chain statistics and inspector panels |
| `tests/test_temporal_chains.py` (NEW) | Unit tests for chain formation and selector bias |

### 2. Key Features

**Temporal Chains:**

- Short event sequences (2–7 steps) with retrospective net_affect
- Formed only during sleep consolidation
- No learning, no gradients, no planning

**Proto-Strategy:**

- Chains bias action selection through `ActionSelector`
- When no other pressures exist, chains deterministically pick best-biased action
- Pure emergence: no self-description, no goals

**Credit Assignment:**

- Retrospective net_affect computed from consequences
- Averaged across chains and usage
- No backpropagation or gradient-based optimization

**Sleep Integration:**

- New processing step in `SleepManager.sleep_cycle()`
- Forms 2–7 length chains from recent hippocampal experiences
- Updates chain net_affect based on experience outcomes

**GUI Display:**

- Memory panel shows chain count and average stability
- Inspector has dedicated chains section
- Feedback ratings, from displeasure to strong approval, used in net_affect calculation

### 3. Testing

**All tests passing (168 total):**

- 165 existing tests remain passing
- 3 new Plan B-specific tests in `test_temporal_chains.py`
- Full coverage: chain formation, bias application, selector integration

```bash
$ pytest -q
168 passed in 0.94s ✅
```

```

## Example Usage

### Create and Run Agent with Chains

```python
from agent import Agent
from hippocampus import NOWAHippocampus
from cortex import CortexMemory
from selector import ActionSelector
from sleep import SleepManager

# Initialize
hip = NOWAHippocampus()
cortex = CortexMemory()
sel = ActionSelector(actions=["action_a", "action_b", "action_c"])
sleep_mgr = SleepManager(hip, cortex)
agent = Agent(hip, cortex, sel, sleep_manager=sleep_mgr)

# Waking behavior
for i in range(20):
    context = ["context:scenario_1"] if i < 10 else ["context:scenario_2"]
    reward = 1.0 if i < 10 else -1.0
    action = agent.step(context, reward=reward)

# Sleep consolidation (chains form here!)
stats = agent.sleep(cycles=3)
print(f"Chains formed: {stats['chains_formed']}")

# Check chain statistics
chains = sleep_mgr.chain_memory.statistics()
print(f"Total chains: {chains['total_chains']}")
print(f"Avg stability: {chains['avg_stability']:.2f}")
```

### Observe Proto-Strategy Behavior

After sleep, the agent shows preference for previously rewarded action sequences without explicit planning:

```python
# Recently rewarded: action_a after context:scenario_1
# Chain forms: ("context:scenario_1", "action:action_a") with net_affect +1.0

# Next time in same context:
context = ["context:scenario_1"]
action = agent.step(context)  # More likely to be "action_a" (proto-strategy)
```

## GUI Enhancements

1. **Memory Panel Update:**

   ```
   Temporal Chains:
     Цепей: 12
     Ср. стабильность: 0.42
   ```

2. **Inspector Tab:**
   - New "Chains" section in Sleep tab
   - Shows formation count, stability metrics
   - Helps debug proto-strategy behavior

3. **Feedback Integration:**
   - User ratings stored in experience consequences
   - Used to compute chain net_affect during sleep

---

## Backward Compatibility

All existing code remains compatible:

- If `chain_memory` not provided, chains simply don't form
- Selector gracefully handles missing `temporal_chains_bias`
- Agent includes try/except for chain computation (safe fallback)
- Existing 165 tests all pass

---

## Next Steps: Plan C

Plan C will introduce **Value Landscapes & Long-Horizon Drift**:

- T3 (very long-term) attractor dynamics
- Multi-scale temporal integration
- Context-dependent value landscapes
- Hierarchical chain composition
